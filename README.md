OCF-Flag is a software to run the new OCF-Flag 2.0 paintball gaming system.

It is also used to run the smaller version of that project, the action case.

It runs on every machine with a JDK. On a raspi it activates the ports so that buttons and LEDs are used.

In it's current state the system implements a centerflag / chessclock style for paintball or airsoft matches.
